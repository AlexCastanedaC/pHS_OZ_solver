# pHS_OZ_solver
A pseudo-hard-sphere (pHS) potential was recently constructed to match the second virial coefficient of the hard-sphere potential and is expected to mimic its thermodynamic properties. The aim of this repository is to show how to use this potential and a Julia package created by @IlianPihlajamaa to solve the Ornstein-Zernike equation.
